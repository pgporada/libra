## What is it made of?

It uses:

- consul for service discovery (and thus consul-template for templating)
- traefik for load balancing
- dumb-init for an init script

And it all runs in Docker, to boot.

## Usage

To run it in your cluster, run this:

```
docker run --rm --name=${APP}-lb -e SERVICE=${APP} --rm -p 8000:80 asteris-llc/libra:latest
```

Where `APP` is the Consul application you would like balanced. Then, connect to
`:8000` and you're done.
